# Assignment 04

## Readings
- Getting Started with p5.js: 5/Response: Control and influence programs with the mouse, keyboard, and touch.

## Game Remake
Create a game inspired by one of the games currently in the collection of the  Museum of Modern as a parody, pastiche, homage, or satire. See a list of games here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_in_the_Museum_of_Modern_Art. These games will be quite simple, geometric, and minimal as you only have a week to complete them. You should only be using the mouse and keyboard for interaction. Keep track of score using on-screen type.
