# Assignment 06

## Chance Collage
Create an collage using found images and text that changes everytime it is viewed (or the broswer is refreshed). Think about how you are altering the original meaning behind the images and text you use through juxtapositon and composition. 

## Tech Notes

### Animated Gifs
If you are using **animated gifs** the first thing you need to do is include `<script src="p5.dom.js"></script>` in your index.html file inbetween referencing p5.js and sketch.js. You will also need to use the `createImg` function instead of `loadImage`. Additionally, you will need to use `imageVariableName.position(x,y)` to place the gif instead of `image(x,y)`.

### Webfonts
For fonts that you find of Google Fonts or other similar webstites you should include the link tag provided (`<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">`), in your index.html file under the script src tags in your header.

Take a newspaper.

Take a pair of scissors.

Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.

Cut out the article.

Then cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in a bag.

Shake it gently.

Then take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they left the bag.

Copy conscientiously.

The poem will be like you.

And here you are a writer, infinitely original and endowed with a sensibility that is charming though beyond the understanding of the vulgar.  

– Tristan Tzara
